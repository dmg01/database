# CONTRIBUTE

Start by forking this repository and cloning your fork locally.

### 1. Decide the game `slug` 

Decide a "slug" for the game you are adding: it's like an username: short, no spaces, special characters or punctuation.

> If the game is called "Super Roto Land : Tales from the Dumper", a good slug would be `super-roto-land-1`.

### 2. Create the game folder and add the related files 

Add the decided game slug in the `gamesList.json` file and create a folder with the slug as name.

> E.g. `gamesList.json` will now contain `"super-loto-land-1` as element, and we created a folder named `super-roto-land-1`

In the created folder, put
- The game ROM (.gb or .gbc);
- The screenshots (PNG, JPG and BMP are supported). At least 1 screenshot is required;

### 3. Add the `game.json` file 

In the folder we just created, create a file called `game.json`:

```
{
    "title": "",
    "slug": "",
    "license": "",
    "developer": "",
    "repository": "",
    "platform": "",
    "typetag": "",
    "tags": [ ],
    "screenshots" : [ ],
    "rom" : ""
}
```

Fill in every property. You can take a look at existing games to make sure everything is correct. 
[This](ucity/game.json) is an example of a correct `game.json`.

`*` represents an optional field.

> E.g. If we added 2 screenshots named `screenshot1.png` and `screenshot2.png` and a ROM named `game.gbc`, the folder structure will look like this:

>├── my-new-game/
>│   ├── my-game.gb
>│   ├── screenshot1.png
>│   ├── screenshot2.png
>│   └── game.json

> Our `game.json` will look like this:

### 4. Check your changes and create a PR

Check the existing folders to have examples of valid entries.

The final folder structure will look like this:

```
database/
├── gamesList.json
├── my-new-game/
│   ├── my-game.gb
│   ├── screenshot1.png
│   ├── screenshot2.png
│   └── game.json
├── another-game/
│   ├── my-game.gb
│   ├── screenshot1.png
│   ├── screenshot2.png
│   └── game.json
├── another-roto-game/
│   ├── my-game.gb
│   ├── screenshot1.png
│   ├── screenshot2.png
│   └── game.json
|
├── [...]
|
```

You're welcome to **edit**, **correct** or **improve** existing entries.
After you're finished and you're sure everything is valid (screenshot and rom names must be identical to the file names you added in the folder) you can commit your changes and propose a Pull Request.
